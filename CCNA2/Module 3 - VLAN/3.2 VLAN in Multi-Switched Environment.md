## ___VLAN Trunks___
- Trunks allow all VLAN traffic to propagate between switches - enables devices on different switches communicated without router
- __Point-to-point__ link between two network devices that carries more than one VLAN
- Doesn't belong into any VLAN
- Standard - __IEEE .1Q__

## ___VLAN Tags___
- __Tagging__ - Using IEEE 802.1Q header
- 4-byte tag
- ___Tag Field___
	- Type - A 2-byte tag protocol ID (TPID) 0x8100
	- User priority - A 3-bit value that supports level or service implementation
	- Canonical Format Identifier(CFI) - A 1-bit, enables __Token Ring__ frames
	- VLAN ID (VID) - A 12-bit identification number. (4096 VLAN IDs)

## ___Native VLAN and Tagging___
- Untagged frame arrives on trunk port --> assigned to the __native VLAN__ (Management frame)
- __Native VLAN__ - Transmit a untagged frames on trunk.
- ___Tagged frames on the Native VLAN__
	- When tagged frame VLAN ID == native VLAN, it drops the frame.
- ___Untagged frame on the Native VLAN__
	- When there is no associated devices + no other trunk ports == frame is dropped
	- If VLAN is configured as the native VLAN, the PVID is the same as the configured VALN.

## ___Voice VLAN Tagging___
- Can use two separate VLANs
	- VLAN for voice traffic
	- Data VLAN to support the host traffic
-
