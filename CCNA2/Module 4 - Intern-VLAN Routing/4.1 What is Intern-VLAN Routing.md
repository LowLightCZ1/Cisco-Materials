- Process of forwarding network traffic from one VLAN to another VLAN
- ___Routing options___
	- Legacy Inter-VLAN routing 
	- Router-on-a-Stick
	- Layer 3 switch using switched virtual interface (SVIs)
## ___Legacy Intern-VLAN Routing___
- legacy solution
- relied on using a router with multiple physical interfaces

Example:
```
Fa01 port is assigned to VLAN10 and is connected to the R1 G/0/0/0 interface
Fa011 port is assigned to VLAN10 and is connected to PC1
Fa012 port is assigned to VLAN20 and is connected to the R1 G0/0/1 interface 
Fa024 port is assigned to VLAN20 and is connected to PC2 
```

## ___Router-on-a-Stick Intern-VLAN Routing___
- Require only one physical interface
- Interfaces configured to __subinterfaces__
	- __Subinterfaces__ - IP address, VLAN assignment
## ___Intern-VLAN Routing on a Layer 3 Switch___
- The modern method
- Switched Virtual Interfaces(SVIs) - virtual interface 
Note: L3 Switch - multilayer switch

__Advantages of L3 Switches:__
- Faster than router-on-a-switch
- No need for external links
- No limited to one link
- Much lower latency
