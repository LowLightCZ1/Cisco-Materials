- __Steps for a Loop-free Topology__
1. Elect the root bridge
2. Elect the root ports
3. Elect designated ports
4. Elect alternate (blocked) ports

- Switches use __BPDUs__ (Bridge Protocol Data Units) to  share information about themself and connections.
- Used to elect the root bridge, ports + designated ports, alternate ports 
- contains BPDU ID (BID) - info which switch sent which BPDU

___Parts of BPDU___
- __Bridge Priority__
	- Cisco default value - 32768
	- Range - 0 to 61440
- __Extended System ID__
	- decimal value to identify the VLAN
	- required 12-bit VLAN ID
- __MAC Address__
	- lower value - lower BID

## ___Elect the Root Bridge___
- STA designates one switch as a __Root Bridge__ - use as a reference point for all calculations
- After switch boots, it sends BPDU frames every 2 sec. 
	- contain Root ID
- Switch with lowest BID become root bridge

## ___Impact of Default BIDs___
- Possible for more switches to have same priority.
- When there are, switch with the lowest __MAC address__ be the root bridge

## ___Determine the Root Path Cost___
- Path Information (__internal root path cost__) - determine by the sum of all the individual ports
- Port cost is defined by:  speed, IEEE 802.1D (__short path cost__); IEEE 802.1w(__long path cost__)
