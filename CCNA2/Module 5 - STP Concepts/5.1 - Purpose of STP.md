- __Redundancy__ - important part of hierarchical design
	- eliminate the possibility of a single point of failure.
- __Loop-free__ topology

## ___Spanning Tree Protocol___
- STP
- loop-preventation network protocol
- Standard - IEEE 802.1D

## ___STP Recalculation___
- If one port is disconnected, STP unblock the port to redirect the path

## ___Issues with Redundant Switch Links___
- When multiple paths exists and no STP is implemented, the Layer 2 loop occurs
- Layer 2 doesn't recognize endlessly looping frame.

 ___Layer 2 Loop___
- Can form frames to loop endlessly
___Broadcast storm___
- Abnormally high number of broadcasts in network during specific time.

## ___Spanning Tree Algorithm___
- Creates a __free-loop topology__ by selecting a single root bridge where all other switches determine a single __least-cost__ path.
