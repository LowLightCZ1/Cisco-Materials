- Allows redundant links between devices 
- Groups more multiple physical link together, creating one big logical
- Provide fault-tolerance, load sharing, increased bandwidth, redundancy between devices.

## ___EtherChannel___
- Originally LAN switch-to-switch by Cisco
- Groups several Fast Ethernet or Gigabit ports into one.
- virtual interface -- port channel
___Advantages:___
- Config. tasks can be done on the EtherChannel interface instead of individual port.
- Relies on existing switch port.
- One or more load-balancing methods can be implemented.
- Create an aggregation that is seen as on logical link. 
(If STP blocks one redundant link, blocks entire EtherChannel) 
- Overall links are seen as one logical connection. 

## ___Implementation Restrictions___
- Interface types can't be mixed (Fast Ethernet x Gigabite Ethernet)
- Can consist of up to __eight__ compatibly-configured ports.
	- Full-duplex up to 800 Mbps (or 8Gbps)
- Supports up to __six__ Channels. 
- Individual EtherChannel group member port must be config. must be on both devices.

## ___AutoNegotiation Protocols___
- __Port Aggregation Protocol (PAgP)__
- __Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP)__
- Allow ports with similar characteristics to form a channel trought dynamic negotiation.

## ___PAgP Operation___
 - If used, PAgP packets are send between Channel-capable ports to negotiate the forming of a channel.
 - If links are identified, it groups them into EtherChannel.
- Packets are send every __30 sec.__
- Check configuations.

___PAgP Modes:___
- __On__ - Forces to channel without PAgP.
- __PAgP desirable__ - Places interfaces in an active negotiation state.
- __PAgP Auto__ - Places interfaces in a passive negotiation state. (Doesn't initiate PAgP negotiation)

## ___LACP Operation___
- IEEE Specification (802.3ad)
- Allows several ports to be bundled to form a single link.
- Works similar as __PAgP__.

___LACP Modes:___
- __On__ 
- __LACP active__ 
- __LACP passive__ 
- All similar to __PAgP modes__.
